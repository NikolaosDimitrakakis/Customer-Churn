## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python exept Spark. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3 and Spark 2.4. Also for the larger dataset you will need IBM or AWS acount

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested to predict customer churn on an imagenery music stremaing service calles Sparkify. For this prject we used Spark SQL and Spark Dataframe to upload and clean the date, SparkMLlib for building and tuning machine learning model.
This is the capstone project for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here with work called "Sparkify.ipynd".  The notebooks includes the phases: loading and cleaning the dataset, exploratoy analysis, feature engineering and modelling.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://nikdimi.medium.com/customer-churn-prediction-with-spark-f71c358a48bb).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Udacity for this capstone project. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
